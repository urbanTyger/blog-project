                <p>We have all potentially done it; planned a journey that would be a zero elevation, perfect
                    temperature, “easy” trip. We have estimated the time down to the second, along with all the supplies
                    needed. It all looks so great, before we even start walking. If you are lucky, most times that trip
                    goes exactly as planned, and when you get home, you have nothing but good memories of the time
                    passed.
                </p>
                <div class="image-with-caption image-center">
                    <img class="blog-image" src="posts/dec/journey/images/success.jpg" alt="success and failure">
                    <p class="caption">Failure and success go hand in hand</p>
                </div>

                <p>But sometimes after going only about 1 km, the steps get harder. It gets harder to simply go into
                    the direction planned. This can be due to traffic, weather, health or numerous other reasons. Life’s
                    journey, is simply sometimes like that.</p>

                <h2>Failure is the first step</h2>

                <p>What I have come to accept as an old man is a lesson I am still learning. That “trip” in life you
                    want to take toward a certain goal, does not usually go according to plan. The cool part of that
                    fact is that it is perfectly okay. This is the normal way even with experience, which should help
                    minimize those parts of the journey being more difficult than planned.</p>

                <p>When do we learn the most? I guess it is better to ask it in another way. When do we forge new
                    information into our head so that it stays there? I would say this is when things are not going
                    smoothly. Smooth and easy makes the mind go into auto-pilot. You do not have to pay much attention
                    because there is not a full thought needed to continue forward. But as soon as you trip and fall on
                    your face with dirt and ants in your mouth, do you realize what you missed. That realization helps
                    cement in your mind the stone, root, leaf or whatever made you fall. If you ever walk the same path
                    again, you will more than hopefully look out for it.</p>

                <h2>Learning is getting back up</h2>

                <p>So when we translate this to a journey in life, as a career or task, we can easily correlate the
                    journey above to it. Trying something new does not come always as second nature to me. I try to plan
                    it out to account for EVERY SINGLE ISSUE that could arise, no matter how improbable. This leads me
                    to most of the time not even attempt my plan. Unlike the Mandalorian, this is not the way.</p>

                <p>In order to get to the goal of success, I have to accept the failure and get over it. I need to
                    learn from it and try again, and again and again. Each time, getting closer to my goal and learning
                    immensely on my way. If I find my goal was wrong, modify it based on what I have learned, but still
                    go towards.</p>

                <h2>Success comes after the first two parts are complete</h2>

                <p>If you keep repeating the learn-fail-learn-fail cycle, it will be disheartening. Those are the parts
                    that stop success from being achieved. Sometimes there are valid reasons to stop and throw in the
                    towel, but most time there are only more reasons to try again differently.</p>

                <p>I am on this goal now, and I hope that after learning Web Development, along with all the “trips” I
                    had on my FIRST project, I will still succeed in my end goal:</p>
